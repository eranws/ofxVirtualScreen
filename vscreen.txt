define 3 screen pts for physical screen. 4 or more for projection.
screen pt is equivalent to screen line (projective)

(center, x, y) //pts
(top, left, right) //lines
(bottom, left, top) //lines
(TL, TR, BR) // top left, ..., bottom right

show intersection points on 2d screen

update point (front)
computeIntersection(pt, pt) // 3d line and plane intersection
"" (pt, radius) // sphere intersection
